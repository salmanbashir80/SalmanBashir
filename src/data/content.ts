    "My work started on the operational side of online selling — researching products, building listings, handling orders and reconciling fees and payouts across real marketplaces. That hands-on foundation shapes everything I do. Today I help online businesses in three connected ways: marketplace services that bring order to listings, operations and profit records; sourcing and freight coordination support that makes buying decisions measurable; and business systems — dashboards, Google Sheets workflows, internal tools and ERP prototypes — built with AI-assisted implementation and planned from the operator's side. I also train sellers and small teams on the practical side of these skills, working remotely with clients connected to the United States, United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden and international online markets.",
